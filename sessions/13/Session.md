  * Filesystems

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Filesystems

> A *file system* is an operating system component that manages data storages and 
> subsequent retrieval.

> A *file system* stores data in *files*, which are stored in *directories*.
> Its file and directories are accessed by specific *paths*, which are 
> compacts maps that locate and identify file system objects.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Filesytems - Paths

Paths are either absolute or relative:

> An *absolute path* is a path relative to file system's *root* directory symbol
> followed by a delimiter hierarchy of directory names that ends in the target 
> directory.

> A *relative path* is a path relative to some other directory. It's expressed
> similarly to an absolute path but without the initial root directory symbol.
